                            <p>Digital Force Bag (DFB) is a utility device that will enable you to perform a host of different and amazing tricks.</p>
                            <p>With a bit of imagination, you can create something unique. DFB allows you to force literally anything from a choice of 100 items.</p>
                            <p>Three lists have already been included so you can start straight away.</p>
                            <p>The examples in Custom Lists 1, 2 & 3 can be retrieved anytime by tapping the RESET LIST button within each list.</p>
                            We know you want to jump straight in, so lets get started with the basics.&nbsp;And remember, if you wish to return to the instructions at any time you must double swipe down.

Your list can be up to 99 items long.<br><br>Be sure to add your FORCE item in the Force Item field.<br><br>You will see that Custom List 1 is currently set with a randomly shuffled deck of playing cards.<br><br>Tap the back-arrow button (Top left).

                            <p>The icons shown within the square represent the numbers&nbsp;1-9 like a telephone keypad. Anywhere outside of this square represents 0.</p>
                            <p>To help you make the swipes as smooth as possible the apps in this square have been carefully designed to incorporate the numbers 1-9. Once you are aware of this you can see it very easily but no one else will be aware of the secret numbering system.</p>
                            <p>Ask your spectator to say a number from 1-100 inclusive. Let's assume they say &ldquo;41".</p>
                            <p>Swipe the screen by placing your finger or thumb on secret square 4 and swiping to the left. This will reveal a second screen of icons.</p>
                            <p>Next, swipe across to the third screen by placing your finger or thumb on the secret square 1 and swiping left again.</p>
                            <p>This will reveal the Notes app. (From this moment the spectator can handle everything under your instruction).</p>
                            <p>Open the Notes app by tapping it.</p><p>Tap on the required list.</p><p>Your force item in every list will now be at the number you secretly coded.</p><p>For numbers 1-9 swipe anywhere outside of the box first (Representing &lsquo;0&rsquo;) to take you to screen two. For 100, swipe anywhere outside of the box on both screens. (0-0)</p><p>If you make an error at any point simply swipe back to the 'previous screen' and start again.</p>
                            <p>From the page where the force item is revealed, you can start the trick again using one of these options:</p>1. Swipe down with two fingers to bring you back to the options on the main page and start again by tapping Perform.<br><p></p>2. Use the secret shortcut. Tap the Back option (Top left of the screen) this will take you back to the Notes list. Now tap either the + symbol (Top right) or the back-arrow button again (top left). This will take you back to the fake app home screen, ready to start again without having to enter the main menu.

                            <p>We suggest saving your own Custom Lists so that you can change them at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>
                            <p>To do this, from the SETTINGS option, tap your Custom List of choice and tap on EXPORT (Top right). This will change your list into a URL which is easily shared with friends and allows for automatic input at a future time.</p>
                            <p>Choose the option COPY TO CLIPBOARD or save it to your own real notes app on your phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Now you can delete the Custom List and build a new one.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>To restore a previous list, find it in your real Notes App and Copy &amp; Paste the hyper link into a web browser. It will automatically open your DFB and ask you if you want to load it into DFB. It will then ask you if you wish to override Custom List 1, 2 or 3. Tap your option and the list will be saved.</p>
                            You can use the Hyperlink to share lists with friends via SMS or email!

                            <p>Have your force item inside an opaque bag. Ask for a number from 1 - 100.</p>
                            <p>Show your shopping list and ask the spectator to reveal the item at the chosen number. Now ask the spectator to open the bag and reveal that the chosen item is inside!</p>

                            <p>Pre-set a deck of cards by taking a Seven of Diamonds from a blue deck and placing it upside down in the middle of a red deck. (Be sure to remove the red Seven of Diamonds).</p>
                            <p>Now ask for a number from 1-52 and then show your list of randomly shuffled cards. Ask them to call out the card at their chosen number (The forced Seven of Diamonds).&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Now ask them to spread the pack face down to reveal a single face up card - the Seven of Diamonds.&nbsp;</p>
                            Finally ask them to turn the Seven over revealing it even has a different colour back!
